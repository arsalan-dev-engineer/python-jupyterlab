    "## Linked Lists Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains a value and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists are used to represent sequences of elements where elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations, unlike arrays.\n",

    "### Key Properties of Linked Lists:\n",

    "- **Nodes**: Each node in a linked list contains two parts:\n",
    "  - **Data**: The value stored in the node.\n",
    "  - **Next**: A reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list.\n",
    "- **Unordered**: The elements are not stored in a contiguous block of memory, and the order is determined by the references between nodes.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Size**: Linked lists can grow or shrink in size dynamically, unlike arrays with a fixed size.\n",
    "- **Linear Structure**: Linked lists have a linear structure, meaning they allow for sequential access to elements.\n",

    "- **Circular Linked List**: The last node in the list points back to the first node, making the list circular.\n",

    "### Operations on Linked Lists:\n",
    "- **Insertion**: Insert a node at the beginning, end, or at a specific position in the list.\n",
    "- **Deletion**: Remove a node from the list.\n",
